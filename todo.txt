	Example of cleaned json made as test_cleaned.json

	Please do some processing so the json sent at movies/ID is usable by the frontend
		- Provide a FULL path to the image. Current json has relative paths of something hosted not by us. fix the url in backend, pass to frontend.
		- Most the data is not used by the frontend, and shouldn't really be sent at all. 
		- Current fields used by frontend: 
			- poster - image url of poster. is base64 data of a donkey right now.
			- overview - displayed summary
			- title
			- id - mainly for sanity while passing data around
		- needs ratings to display and modify

		- I left most the test-json-reading code in view.py unmodified, but learn to use the "with open('file_name.txt') as file:" syntax. I don't think it gets closed atm (perhaps not a problem when I'm reloading the server every 2 minutes, prolly will be at some point)

		- endpoint - let frontend post a set of ratings
			- this would be where you do ip verification as well, if we want to go that route
		- endpoint - place/method to get the trending/new movies

	- actually make the movie page css
	- figure out how to handle routing so that going straight to http://127.0.0.1:8000/show_movie/1 loads the react page AND goes straight to the movie page
	- css
		- movie page...
		- css square the movie poster images, should be flexibler
	- figure out which...things SHOULD be components vs functions and make them such
	- refactor  
		- indents, 
		- movieslider.js
		- states, I see I see
	- search bar is ugly
	- scrollbars
	- later - possibly discuss how the bulk fetching is done?
